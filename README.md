# Title: All-Roomer
All-Roomer is like an all-nighter, except it contains everything you need to stay in your room all day. 

# What and why?
All-Roomer compiles your favorite YouTube videos, Netflix shows, Spotify songs, and more so you never have to leave your room. It organizes everything on one site so there is no need to switch programs or sign in to multiple different accounts to access videos/shows/songs. This saves time and makes enjoyment at home a lot more convenient. 

# For whom?
This software is intended for people of all ages who have free time or like staying indoors. The appeal of this software may be to young people who are very familiar with YouTube, Netflix, and Spotify. 

# How?
All-Roomer will be a GUI that compiles and organzies YouTube videos, Netflix shows, and Spotify songs in their own sections. There will be a sidebar that allows the user to naviagate between the different sections. There will also be a search bar at the top of the interface that allows the user to search for any video, show, or song. The user can also play a Netflix show or YouTube video at the same time, similar to split screening. Moreover, the user can play a Spotify song in the background while watching a YouTube video, with the duration/volume bar of the song directly underneath the video. 

# Scope
This project is definitely suitable for a group of 4-6 people since it is mostly front-end work. The shows, videos, and songs will be fetched from their respective APIs. The programmer's main job is to organize this fetched data and render it in a user-friendly manner.
